Problem statement: There is no good Stargate game - so I decided to create the core of one to build up myself, referencing my love of D&D and the stargate-concept for choosing a destination to explore.

Proposed solution: Create a windows console app text-based game that will allow a user to create a character and go on an adventure; a randomly chosen location. Additional features to be added over time.

Approximate timeframe: July 17th – August 3rd, 2017

Estimate of resources: Developer time from one developer 10 hours a week for about 3 weeks, acquisition of developers’ tools.
